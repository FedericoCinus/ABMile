ABM for the Last Mile Problem

In this work is introduced the Last Mile problem and the Agent-Based modelling process. A solution for the Last Mile problem is proposed suggesting an active engagement of the population. Some estimation has been done in order to make the simulation suitable for representing the city of Turin and actual cost of the delivering process. Genetic algorithms provided an optimized solution. Results show the robustness of the proposed solution both in economical and userâ€™s engagement terms, discussing also extreme situation.
